# Live Bus Tracker
 MBTA Bus Tracker

DESCRIPTION

This program retrieves data on the busses currently operating in the boston area and displays both their current location as well as their bearing.

MY UPDATES
1) Made a loop to update a marker for each bus instead of just 1
2) Added color to each bus marker
3) Made the markers rotate according to the bus's bearing
4) Changed the display style of the map

This program is contained on a single html page

FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
I would like to add functionality where the user can click on a marker and have information about that specific vehicle displayed, such as its next intended stop.

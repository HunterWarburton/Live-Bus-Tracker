# Real Time Bus Tracker
 MBTA Bus Tracker

>https://hunterwarburton.github.io/LiveBusTracker/LiveBusTracker.html

## DESCRIPTION

This program retrieves actual real-time data on the busses currently operating in the boston area and displays both their current location as well as their bearing.
Using APIs from:
Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority
Mapbox

## MY UPDATES
1) Made a loop to update a marker for each bus instead of just 1
2) Added color to each bus marker
3) Made the markers rotate according to the bus's bearing
4) Changed the display style of the map

## HOW TO USE
This project requires importing apis from MBTA and Mapbox.
Mapbox requires the use of an accessToken. The code provided has the phrase INSERTACCESSTOKENHERE which needs to be replaced by an accessToken obtained from mapbox.

## FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
I would like to add functionality where the user can click on a marker and have information about that specific vehicle displayed, such as its next intended stop.
